                <ul><li>Hello! My name is Corin Marasco, I’m a physics major at Georgia Tech, and this summer I worked with
                    Dr. Kristin Madsen in the X-ray astrophysics lab on cross-calibrations of x-ray satellites using the
                    quasar 3C 273!
                </li></ul>
                <div style="padding-top: 52px; padding-bottom: 32px">
                    <img src="observations_slide.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 10px; max-width:80%; max-height: 80%"></img>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Here are the four satellites we cross-calibrated. They all observed the quasar 3C 273 from 2015-2021,
                    and we have analyzed the data from all seven years for a more accurate cross-calibration analysis.</li>
                    <li>The satellites we used are NuSTAR, Swift, Chandra, and XMM-Newton.</li>
                    <li>NuSTAR observes in by far the hardest X-ray band out of these four observatories, from 3-79 keV.
                    However, unlike the other three, it does not operate in the soft X-ray band below 3 keV. It has
                    two theoretically identical instruments that it uses for observations, FPMA and FPMB, which were
                    analyzed separately in this study.</li>
                    <li>Swift is a multiwavelength observatory which houses an X-ray telescope called XRT that operates
                    in about the 0.2-10 keV band. Swift XRT collects data through two modes, photon counting and windowed
                    timing. For our analysis, we used the windowed timing data because it was available for every observation.
                    <li>Chandra observes in the 0.08-10 keV band using two grating spectrometers: LETGS and HETGS. They
                    observe in different X-ray bands for better overall resolution. In order to match the bands from
                    other observatories, just the data from HETGS was used.</li>
                    <li>Our last satellite, XMM-Newton, observes in the 0.15-15 keV band. It houses three instruments that
                    it uses for X-ray observations, MOS1 and MOS2, which are theoretically identical, and pn, which
                    uses different gratings for collection. These instruments were analyzed separately in this study.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, these satellites have different orbits, influencing their collection data. NuSTAR and Swift
                    have a low Earth orbit, while Chandra and XMM have highly elliptical orbits.</li>
                </ul>
                <div style="padding-top: 52px; padding-bottom: 32px">
                    <img src="gtis_slide_1.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 10px; max-width:80%; max-height: 80%"></img>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Good time intervals or GTIs are periods of time when the observatory was collecting usable data.</li>
                    <li>To compare the observational data between observatories, we first found good time intervals
                        where the observations overlapped.</li>
                    <li>Like I mentioned in the last slide, NuSTAR and Swift have low earth orbits, which causes them to
                        have these short GTI spans as the Earth gets in the way of the target. Chandra and XMM are
                        uninterrupted because their orbit allows them to swing out far from the Earth and collect data
                        for longer periods of time.</li>
                    <li>For better accuracy, the satellites were compared and analyzed as pairs instead of limiting our
                        study to the short periods of time where all four GTIs overlap.</li>
                    <li>The lightcurve on the right shows the counts per second collected by each satellite in 2018.</li>
                    <li>As you can see in the lightcurves, there is a lot of data that occurs outside the short
                        spans where all four observations overlap, and some of that might be worth including, like
                        the dip in the blue Swift data.</li>
                </ul>
                <div style="padding-top: 52px; padding-bottom: 32px">
                    <img src="gtis_slide_2.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 10px; max-width:80%; max-height: 80%"></img>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>This table details the GTIs shown in the plot on the left.</li>
                    <li>Because we analyzed the satellites in pairs, we identified six GTI intervals for every year.
                        The six for 2018 are listed here.</li>
                    <li>You can see how much more of the exposure time we get to use when we compare the satellites
                        in pairs. Instead of using just 14,000 seconds of NuSTAR data because it’s limited by Chandra,
                        we can use 35,000 seconds when it’s compared to Swift and 30,000 when compared with XMM-Newton.</li>
                    <li>So comparing the satellites in pairs allows us to use more of the collected data and hopefully
                        obtain a more accurate cross-calibration.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Before we look at the collected data, let's talk about the source we used.</li>
                    <li>3C 273 is a Seyfert 1 quasar dominated by its coronal emission.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">A quasar is a very bright active galactic nuclei, and, similar
                        to the sun, it has a corona
                        and its corona is the primary source of its x-ray emission.</li>
                    <li>3C 273 the closest high-luminosity quasar, and was the first quasar ever detected.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">It’s so bright that if it was as far as 10 parsecs away, it
                        would be as bright as the sun!</li>
                    <li>Its spectrum is dominated by a power-law model in the X-ray band that we examined.</li>
                    <li>We use 3C 273 for cross-calibration because it is very bright across the X-ray band,
                        it has been heavily studied, and it’s spectrum is very featureless, so it’s easier
                        to fit a model to.</li>
                </ul>
                <div style="padding-top: 52px; padding-bottom: 32px">
                    <img src="fit_slide.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-radius: 10px; max-width:80%; max-height: 80%"></img>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>For each of the six satellite pairs, we fit a power-law model to the data.</li>
                    <li>Because of NuSTARs harder energy band, the three pairings that involved NuSTAR were
                        analyzed in the 3-7 keV band, and the other three pairings without NuSTAR were analyzed
                        in the 1-5 keV band.</li>
                    <li>We used a power-law model because, as shown in the ratio plot in the figure on the
                        left, the power-law fit describes 3C 273 very well. Because we only analyzed data
                        in the 1-10 keV range, the power law accurately fits the energy range our study
                        focuses on, even though there’s a dip in the end of the plot.</li>
                    <li>For each satellite pairing, we first fit the model to the spectrum from each
                        instrument separately to determine the photon index and flux within that GTI.</li>
                    <li>Then, as shown in the picture below with Swift and NuSTAR, we fit the data from
                        all instruments in the observatory pair together to get the ratio of the measured
                        flux to the model flux.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Here are the estimates for the flux and photon index values for each satellite
                        pair that was fitted in 2018. These confidence contours show the range we expect
                        the flux and photon index to be in.</li>
                    <li>The actual photon index and flux value is most likely (68%) to be in the
                        centermost oval, it is probably within the 2nd oval (95%), and almost certainly
                        within the outermost.</li>
                    <li>We created these confidence contours because they are a useful way to visualize
                        how much agreement there is between observatories.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">If they overlap, like NuSTAR and Chandra in the center
                        of the top row, those satellites are more likely to agree with each other.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">If the contours don’t touch each other, like Swift and
                        XMM or Swift and Chandra in the bottom row, we can deduce that the satellites
                        do not agree with each other.</li>

                    <li>These are the NuSTAR and XMM confidence contours for all six years of data
                        (the 2021 data isn’t included because it isn’t available yet for XMM).</li>
                    <li>Here, we can see trends and notable changes by comparing confidence contours
                        over time.</li>
                    <li>Looking at these, we see that there is typically clear agreement between the
                        NuSTAR and the XMM MOS instruments over time, but XMM’s pn instrument (in the
                        cyan) ranges from agreeing with the other instruments, like in 2015 or 2019,
                        to measuring a much lower flux value, like in 2016 and 2017.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>These flux ratio plots from 2018 show the ratio of the measured flux to our
                        model flux when an observatory pair is fitted together. These give us an
                        idea of how good our fit was. Ideally, this ratio would be one at all energy
                        levels for all instruments.</li>
                    <li>Many of these fits are close to a flux ratio of 1, which tells us that they
                        are good fits, such as Chandra and NuSTAR in the top middle or NuSTAR and
                        Swift in the top right.</li>
                    <li>We see many of the trends in these plots repeated over all seven years of
                        data, which we can see in the next slide.</li>

                        interesting trend, however this has been well-documented and is expected.</li>
                    <li>The NuSTAR flux ratios are consistently scattered around a flux ratio of
                        1, which is also what we would expect, and it’s a sign of a good fit.</li>

                        the columns to the flux of the NuSTAR instruments on the left.</li>
                    <li>Here, we notice trends that can be expected, such as FPMB being slightly
                        higher than FPMA, the NuSTAR instruments being very similar to the XMM
                        MOS instruments, and XMM’s pn instrument measuring a lower flux than the
                        NuSTAR instruments.</li>
                    <li>However, these tables strongly indicate that our Swift data needs to be
                        revisited because Swift has an uncharacteristically low cross-normalization
                        constant and high standard deviation.</li>

                        Chandra.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">These extractions were done by myself, so we
                        plan to check them with experts and to clean up the mistakes in the
                        Swift extractions and fit.</li>
                    <li>We also plan to include the 2021 XMM data once that’s available.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, we plan to publish a paper with these results!</li>
                    <li>The main reason this work is so essential is because cross-calibrations
                        of satellites ensures accurate results can be obtained from these
                        observatories, which impacts many areas of X-ray astrophysics. So we
                        hope that this work can serve as a reference for those using data collected
                        from different satellites at different times to ensure that their
                        measurements are as accurate as possible.</li>
